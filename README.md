# Reservation_System_Using_OOP
## here's an `updated` version of the `main()` method that prompts the `user to input` the necessary information for reserving a room
## you can see `main` from  [HERE](https://github.com/AhemdMahmoud/Reservation_System_Using_OOP)

### This version of the `main()` method uses `a Scanner object` to prompt the user for their `name, email address, phone number, check-in date, and check-out date`. It then displays the `available rooms` for the given `date range` and `prompts the user to select a room to reserve`. Finally, it reserves the selected room using the `reserveRoom()` method and `displays the total cost` of the reservation.
