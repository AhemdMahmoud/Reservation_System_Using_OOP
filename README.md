# Hotel Reservation System
### The Hotel Reservation System is a Java program that allows users to reserve hotel rooms for a given date range. The program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to input their personal details and select a room for reservation. The program then reserves the selected room and displays the total cost of the reservation.




## ` Installation `

### Clone the repository to your local machine:
### 1- bash Copy code
 `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hotel-reservation-system.git`



### 2- Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (such as `Eclipse`,`IntelliJ IDEA`, or `NetBeans`).

### 3- Run the Main class to start the program.
# ` Features`
 ## The Hotel Reservation System provides the following features:

- ### Reservation of hotel rooms for a given ` date range`.
- ### Display of `available rooms` for the given date range.
- ### `Selection` of a room from the `list` of available rooms.
- ### `Reservation` of the selected room for the given date range.
- ### Calculation of the `total cost`of the reservation.
# `Usage`
- ### When the program starts, the user is prompted to `input their personal details`, including their `name`, ` email address `, and `phone number`.

- ### The user is then prompted to input the `check-in` and `check-out` dates for their stay.

- ### The program `displays` a list of available rooms for the selected` date range`, including the `room type`, `room number`, and `price per night``.

- ### The user `selects` a room from the list of available rooms.

- ### The program `reserves` the selected room for the given date range and `displays` the total cost of the reservation.

 ## `Technologies Used`
### The Hotel Reservation System is written in Java and uses the following libraries and frameworks:

 - [x] ` JavaFX` : JavaFX is used to create the graphical user  ` interface (GUI)` for the program.
- [x] `LocalDate`: LocalDate is used to represent the check-in and check-out dates for the reservation.
- [x] `ArrayList`: ArrayList is used to store the list of rooms in the hotel.
## `ABOUT NEW_BRANCH `
 ## I also create `new_branch` and  `updated` version of the main() method that prompts the `user to input` the necessary information for reserving a room and can see this From here [an updated version of the main() method ](https://github.com/AhemdMahmoud/Reservation_System_Using_OOP/tree/user-input)
 
## `Credits`
## The Hotel Reservation System was created by  `Ahmed Mahmoud`  as a project for develope ` my Skills`
